# Basic Runtime Optimization
A very basic ART/JIT optimization, made for fun.

## Features
- Set SystemUi and System_Server to more efficient profiles for use. This improves the accuracy of memory management and even cleans it up with HeapTaskDaemon, the System_Server garbage collector.
- Reduces useless ART debugging and logging, considering that regular users would have a hard time getting this information without a computer. This also reduces the size of applications by a few megabytes; in my case, it made Minecraft Pocket weigh 30MB less.
- Apply the speed-profile to all user apps every 7 days, and at the end of each month (30 days after the module was installed), DEX file synchronization, image compilation, and unused DEX file cleaning are applied. In addition: allow the user to modify the timing of these optimizations, dividing them between: speed-profile and final clean.
- Pin dex2oat threads to big cores, enable batch parallelism which makes compilation and runtime movement execution faster, reducing batch time by ~20%.
- Complete change in Dexopt profiles! Now ART/JIT can compile certain areas of the system with the correct profile for them. This generally reduces CPU usage, storage usage and even RAM usage proportionally by giving the correct and most optimized profile for Dexopt to compile something from the system instead of being extremely aggressive with the Runtime.
- Make the interpreter a little better, slightly improving runtime performance when interpreting code.
- Make sure the DEX is 64bit, for ROMs that don't have this optimization.
- And best of all... it's Open Source! If you want to help this project with additional optimizations, tips, etc., let me know, I'd really appreciate help with this project that I made with the purpose of being fun and a way to pass the time.

### Warning!
If you use it together with my Basic Cleaner module, remember to set the same speed-profile and final cleaning times in the panels of this module and the basic cleaner. Don't worry, both will not run at the same time. Whereas the basic cleaner and basic runtime when run, they will check the period between them. The first one that runs will cancel the execution of the second one because it is in the same "period".
